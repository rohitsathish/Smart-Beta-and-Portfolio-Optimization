# Smart-Beta-and-Portfolio-Optimization

In this project, I built a smart beta portfolio and compared it to a benchmark index. To find out how well the smart beta portfolio did, I calcuated the tracking error against the index. I then built a portfolio by using quadratic programming to optimize the weights. The code will rebalance this portfolio and calculate turn over to evaluate the performance. I'll then use this metric to find the optimal rebalancing frequency. For the dataset, I used end of the day data from Quotemedia.
